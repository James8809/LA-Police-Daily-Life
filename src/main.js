// James Liu, Darren Yang, LA Police daily life
// we havent really complete it yet so we have to turn in what we have
// used multiple scene class, transition between scene class
// have instructions, have player input control
// animated police and truck car, scolling with a tilesprite?
// implement pyhsics.arcade collision, have looping bgm
// theoretically endless, playable for 15 seconds
// used randomness to generate trucks
// we have our game art assets mostly done by ourselves but not the sounds
// we were trying to add a game ai that can be displayed at the front 
// of the road as thief that player was supposed to chase
// but werent really able to implemet in time (see the commented out code)
// we really like what we did for the police car and truck but couldn't 
// really add more since we dont have time left. we had a great idea of 
// having to player chase thief as a police but couldn't finish in time :(
// oh also we added a kind of funny feature so try to find it if you can haha
